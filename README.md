# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the repository for my traffic accident data analysis project, completed during my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset containing traffic accident records.
# Task 5

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions,weather and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contribution factors.
# Methodology

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted data types, and ensured consistency across the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the distribution and relationships of key variables to uncover patterns and insights.
Visualization: Created various plots and charts to visually represent the data and findings.
# Key Findings

City-wise Distribution: Miami is the city with the most number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg have the least.
State-wise Distribution: California has the highest number of accidents, whereas South Dakota has the least.
Yearly Trends: The year 2021 saw the highest number of accidents.
Severity Levels: Most accidents were classified at severity level 2.
Weather Conditions: The majority of accidents occurred under fair weather conditions.
Time of Day: Most accidents happened in the morning.
# Conclusion

This analysis highlights key patterns in traffic accident data, such as high accident rates in densely populated areas like Miami and California, and a significant number of accidents occurring under fair weather conditions in the morning. These insights can inform road safety initiatives and policy decisions to reduce accidents and improve public safety.
